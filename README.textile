h1. Learning Erlang by Doing

This is just some code i hacked together to get a feeling for erlang. As such, it's
incomplete and very unmemorable but at least i won't loss it if my harddrive dies.

The main aim was to get a network storage simulation working in which the packets would
carry data and maintain that data by pinging it around the network. Data could then
be retrieved by doing a DNS-like lookup for packets.

A second aim was the combination of ruby with erlang to do something useful, that turned
to be unstable because of the bridge between ruby and erlang.
